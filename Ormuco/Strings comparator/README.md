# String comparator library

What I did is that I created a String comparator class that has both of the string as attributes.

The package has two .py files, string_comparator is the one who uses comparator, in comparator the class String comparator is defined and another two functions: compare and check_strings, the first function is to compare both of strings and the second one is for validating that none of the strings are NoneType.

In the string_comparator there are all the test cases and a function called test, what it does is that first check if both strings are valid and after that compares them.
